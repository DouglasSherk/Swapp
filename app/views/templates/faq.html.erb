  <p>This section will answer your most commonly asked questions.</p>

  <h3>Pay as you waste, what is it, who is affected?</h3>
  <p>If you place garbage out for collection in Stratford you will be paying
  direct for the cost of collecting and disposing of that garbage at the
  landfill site. The pay as you waste system treats garbage like a utility where
  decreased usage means decreased costs. All garbage placed out for collection
  needs to be tagged for collection.</p>

  <h3>How do I dispose of large items?</h3>
  <h4>White Goods</h4>
  <p>The City of Stratford currently collects large appliances or white goods on
  a monthly collection. Residents pay $40 for an appliance that contains or may
  have contained freon and $22 for one that does not contain Freon. The item is
  collected, emptied of freon if necessary, and recycled or repaired. This
  program will continue as part of the Pay as You Waste System. These items are
  not accepted at the landfill site.</p>
  <p>The schedule is the 3rd Monday of each month unless it falls on a holiday
  then it will be the Tuesday.</p>
  <h4>Large Items</h4>
  <p>A large item is any item larger or heavier than a bundle described in the
  chart above (a chesterfield or desk for example). Large items will need to be
  tagged for pick up and will be collected on your regular garbage day. If you
  are disposing of such items, a tag can be purchased at the Engineering and
  Public Works Department, 82 Erie Street, 3rd Floor. Large item tags cost
  $10.00. Large items are also accepted at the landfill site at $74.50 per
  tonne.</p>

  <h3>Backyward Composters</h3>
  <p>Composters are available to purchase for $25 each at City Annex, 82 Erie
  Street, 3rd Floor, then you pick up the composter at Public Works Division,
  303 King Street.</p>

  <h3>Free Compost</h3>
  <p>Residents can pick up to one cubic meter of finished compost while supply
  lasts. Commercial users and landscapers can purchase compost for $3.50 per
  cubic meter. Call (519) 271-0250 extension 279 for availability of
  compost.</p>

  <h3>No man, I don't eat pork</h3> <p>Normally, both your asses would be dead
as fucking fried chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a
transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't
give you this case, it don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through
too much shit this morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.
</p>

  <h3>We happy?</h3> <p>Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from
South Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun in American crime.
Do you believe that shit? It actually says that in the little book that comes
with it: the most popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud of
that shit.  </p>

  <h3>Are you ready for the truth?</h3> <p>Now that we know who you are, I know
who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you
can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the
hero. And most times they're friends, like you and me! I should've known way
back when... You know why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.

  <h3>I can do that</h3> <p>Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking
fried chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional
period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't give you this
case, it don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit
this morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass. </p>

  <h3>I gotta piss</h3> <p>Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a
slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you see
a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a
mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's
what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in a toy store, because
you're here shopping for an infant named Jeb. </p>

  <h3>Hold on to your butts</h3> <p>Now that we know who you are, I know who I
am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you can
tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero.
And most times they're friends, like you and me! I should've known way back
when... You know why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass. </p>
